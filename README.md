# SENG2021
Requirements &amp; Design workshop at UNSW

In this course, the goal was to create a full stack web app that would help small businesses in adopting mandatory e-invoicing in Aus-NZ.

This project was self guided and developed in small teams, with some team members working on design, requirements engineering, backend, frontend, stack design and documentation.
My main contributions were to:
- Stack Design
- Managing AWS ec2, s3
- Creating backend functionality (with the exception of create.ts)
- Assisting to develop frontend
- Requirements Engineering
